# Heart Stroke Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Heart stroke is a serious medical condition that requires early detection to prevent severe health complications. This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on various health parameters.

## ⚙️ Features
- Predicts stroke risk based on user input
- Uses a trained ML model (`stroke_model.pkl`)
- Implements data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Provides a user-friendly interface for prediction

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Web Framework (if applicable):** Flask / Streamlit
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset includes features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, BMI, etc.
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (or mention actual dataset source)

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/asatyasaideepika11/Heart-Stroke-Prediction.git
cd Heart-Stroke-Prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Model (If Using Flask)
```bash
python app.py
```

### 4️⃣ Predict Stroke Risk
- If using a web app, open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
- Enter the required parameters and get predictions
